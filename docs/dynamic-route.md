The `Stack` and `Stack.Screen` components you're using here are specific to **`expo-router`**, which is an Expo-specific feature. Since you're now working with a **React Native bare workflow**, you should replace **`expo-router`** with **React Navigation**'s stack navigator.

In **React Navigation**, you set up stack navigators differently. Here's how you can refactor your `HomeLayout` to use React Navigation instead of `expo-router`:

### Steps:

1. **Install React Navigation (if you haven't already)**:
   Run the following commands to install React Navigation and its dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install @react-navigation/native @react-navigation/native-stack
   npm install react-native-screens react-native-safe-area-context
   ```

2. **Replace `expo-router` Stack with React Navigation's Stack Navigator**:
   You'll need to replace `Stack` from `expo-router` with **React Navigation's** `createNativeStackNavigator`.

### Updated Code:

```js
import React from 'react';
import {createNativeStackNavigator} from '@react-navigation/native-stack';
import IndexScreen from './screens/IndexScreen'; // Adjust these paths
import ControlsScreen from './screens/ControlsScreen'; // Adjust these paths
import ControlOptionsScreen from './screens/ControlOptionsScreen'; // Adjust these paths

const Stack = createNativeStackNavigator(); // Initialize the stack navigator

const HomeLayout = () => {
  return (
    <Stack.Navigator screenOptions={{headerShown: false}}>
      {/* Define the screens in the stack */}
      <Stack.Screen name="Index" component={IndexScreen} />
      <Stack.Screen name="Controls" component={ControlsScreen} />
      <Stack.Screen name="ControlOptions" component={ControlOptionsScreen} />
    </Stack.Navigator>
  );
};

export default HomeLayout;
```

### Key Changes:

1. **Use `createNativeStackNavigator`**:
   - This replaces the `Stack` component from `expo-router`. React Navigation's `createNativeStackNavigator` is used for stack navigation in React Native.
2. **Replace `Stack.Screen` from `expo-router`**:
   - Instead of using `Stack.Screen` from `expo-router`, we now use `Stack.Screen` from React Navigation.
3. **Replace Screen Names**:

   - In React Navigation, screen names are arbitrary and don't rely on a folder structure like `expo-router` does. You should give the screens meaningful names (e.g., `Index`, `Controls`, `ControlOptions`).

4. **Dynamic Routes**:

   - If you had a dynamic route like `"controlOptions/[id]"` in `expo-router`, you should use **React Navigation's params** to pass data between screens. Instead of defining `[id]` in the route, you'd pass it as a parameter:

   ```js
   <Stack.Screen
     name="ControlOptions"
     component={ControlOptionsScreen}
     options={{headerShown: false}}
   />
   ```

   Then, in your `ControlOptionsScreen`, you can access the `id` using the `route` prop:

   ```js
   import React from 'react';
   import {Text, View} from 'react-native';

   const ControlOptionsScreen = ({route}) => {
     const {id} = route.params; // Get the 'id' param

     return (
       <View>
         <Text>Control Options for {id}</Text>
       </View>
     );
   };

   export default ControlOptionsScreen;
   ```

### Example of Param Usage in React Navigation:

```js
navigation.navigate('ControlOptions', {id: 123});
```

And in `ControlOptionsScreen`, access the parameter using `route.params`:

```js
const {id} = route.params; // This will access the 'id' param
```

### Summary:

- Replace **`expo-router`'s `Stack` and `Stack.Screen`** with React Navigation's `createNativeStackNavigator`.
- Use React Navigation's **params** to pass dynamic data like `id`.
- Ensure your navigation hierarchy is properly defined in **React Navigation's `Stack.Navigator`**.

By following these steps, you'll have successfully migrated your layout from **`expo-router`** to **React Navigation** in a React Native bare workflow project. Let me know if you need further assistance!
